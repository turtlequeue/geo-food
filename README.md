# Technologies

### TurtleQueue

Used to broadcast a message (ie: a burito emoji) to peers connected to the app.

### React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and relies on react hooks. Which are quite cool but might look weird if you are not used to them. Take a look at [reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

### GMap

Expect some hacky piece of code to achieve marker animation on the map üôç

### Emotion

Provides elegant way to use css in js
